0x16. C - Simple Shell

Created by Dania Sciarappa and Obinyan Victory Osemudiamen.

In preporation for the project, we have created a readme doc.

We have created a pid.c, a shell.h and a main.c file thereafter.

the shell.h file acts as our prototype file inwhich we will continue
to work on whilst all assignments are being completed and compiled.
